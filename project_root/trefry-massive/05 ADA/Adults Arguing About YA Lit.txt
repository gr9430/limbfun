Many Universes, Ingression, and Indeterminate ----Raven Thacoori

Pleasures of Starvation, Incipient Incineration, Waxdove 



-- My Daughter is Leaving These Bookies Around The Apartment And I've An Absorption With Both Triloginas, But I'm Thinking I'm Leaning Toward the <<Many Universes>> Trilogy In Lieu Of the <<Pleasures of Starvation>> Trilogy, The Hype For <<PoS>> is Really Ruiny For Me, It is Hyperboliculusness, With All The Fallgirly Stuff Abounding, Yes, I've An Abiding Tenderness For <<PoS>>, But The Characters are Seemingly Stale, With Only A Few Satisfactory Plottwisties In The Volume, In The First Volume Of <<Many Universes>>--The Only One In My Head, Honestly--The Plottwists are So <<Oh My, No, Not This Person>> Or <<No, That Character is So Crucial>> So, I've A Preference For <<MU>>, <<Gore/Hemings>> is A Poo Darling, <<Franz>> is Fine In The Beginning Of <<MU Volume 1>>, And I've An Absorption With The Woman From The Tattooparlor, She is One Of My Favorite Characties In All Of Literature, My Declaration, The Character Development In <<MU>> is Just A Little Bit Superior --

-- There is No Ambiguity About It, The <<Pleasures of Starvation>> Trilogy is Tremendulously Easily Superior, <<Many Universes>> is A Fun Tale But The Narratichik & Characters & Writing In <<PoS>> are Much More Effective And Believable, The <<PoS>> Trilogy Also Isn't Focal On Romance Or Obsession As <<Many Universes>> --

-- I've A General Affinity For Both Trilogies But <<Many Universes>> is Definitely My Preference--With The Exception Of <<Ingression>> Being Such An Absolute Snoreculus Of An Encyclopedoa--, As Per My Discussion With Radien, The Hype And Craziness Over <<PoS>> is Kinda Giving Me A General Ambivalence Toward It, I've Also Just A Preferette For <<Many Universes>>, There isn't A Grating Triangular Obsession Slowing Down The Actionjaction, Each Character's Development And Story is Evolutionarily More Elegantness And The Concept is Really Amazing Without being Overly Gruesomey --
 
-- The <<Many Universes>> Series is The Best Literary Trilogina, I'm Reading It And I am Feeling Happy & Angry--And Listless In Those Expository Encyclopedias & Clippings & Tabular Constructions of <<Ingression>>--But Mostly Sad--Primarily In The Last Booky <<Indeterminate>>--, This Trilogy is Breaking My Heart Over And Over, I'm Rereading <<Indeterminate>, I am A <<Many Universes>> Chainreaderlet, There is No Other Trilogina Standing Up To This Rereading And I am In A Loving Absorption With <<Hemings>> Because He is Truly Serious & Strong & Cutikin --

-- My Daughter And I've A Preference For Triangular Obsessions In Narrative, Because How are You Really Fully Embodying The Development Of A Character Without Seeing Their Behavior In A Triangular Obsession, And I am Writing My Own Subplot As A Bridging Cliffhanglet Between <<Many Universes>> & <<Ingression>> In Which <<Gore/Hemings>> is In A Nasty Prisona And <<Pris>> is With <<Franz>> On The Outside But She is Agonizing Over A Jailbreak Strategitta For <<Hemings>> And Your Knowledge is That This is Straining Her Bonny Relationship With <<Franz>>, I'm Not Saying What is Happening In My Amendment To <<Indeterminate>> Other Than Raven Thacoori's Ending is Disappointing And I am Bringing A Third Boylan Boylet Into The Trilogy--I am Calling Him <<Taser>>--Who <<Pris>> is Having A Brief Affairella With And <<Hemings>> is Getting Jealous But <<Pris>> is Realizing She And <<Hem>> are Soulmatesies --

-- But Having No Triangular Obsession is Amazingness Because Most Bookies are Centering Around Triangular Obsessions And They are Just Getting So Stale And So Annoying Because You've An Infatuatula With The Hunksy Vertex But That Beautiful Angle is Adrift Without The Person You're Thinking They're Belonging With, My Determination is A Preference For <<Many Universes>> Without A Triangular Obsession --

-- I'm Sympathetic To What You are Saying And The Triangular Obsession Thing Definitely is Really In A Situation Of Oversaturationy Tedium, Maybe You're Right--Maybe <<Hemings>> & <<Pris>> Going Through Their Own Tribulockies Of Upsies And Downlets is Enough For My Satisfaculus --

-- On My Sweet Mother's Graviolus, Every Other Booky has An Obsession Triangle, The Idea Of A <<Many Universes>> Triangular Obsession is Destroying My Soulkin, I am Barely Tolerant Of <<Pris>> And <<Hemings>> Obvious Romanticle Friction Even Though It Was The Primary Maintainer Of My Readerly Attention, My Determination is They are A Perfectikie Pairing -- 

-- <<Many Universes>> is Definitely My Gotopoo, The Characterization is Superiority And So is The Personality Layout For Each Characternie, Whereas In <<Pleasures of Starvation>> There are Characters Never Truly Permissive Of Readerly Dissection--For Instance--are We Really Scansioning The Gastrics Of <<Koons>>, Everything is So Superficial Even In His Discussion Of Classical Motifs, <<Koons>> is My Favorite <<PoS>> Characternie And I've No Knowledge Of His Guts, Also The Plottwisties In <<Pleasures of Starvation>> are Devastation, It's Agreeabling, But None Of Them are Mechanical Integral To The Narrative Yet In <<Many Universes>> All Of The Twisties are Abiding And Indelibly Horribleness, My Determination is <<Pleasures of Starvation>> is An Amazingling Opus Of Creativity And A Wondrous Tale But In <<Many Universes>> The Level Of Craftiness And Formal Quality Polishment is A Loadlet Above -- 

-- I've An Abiding Absorption For Both Triloginas, <<PoS>> is Of Undescribeably Amazingly Textual Polishment, I am Chainreading All The Three Bookies, However I am Fantasizing About Deviations From Zanne's Narrative Layout In The Bookies, I've Really An Undying Adoration For All The Characties And I'm Weeping For Their Dissection In The Bookies, The Trilogy is Just The Ultimate Captivation, Contrarily <<Many Universes>> is Also Amazingness, I am Glowing And Effusively Reading Every Word, I am Up Late At Night Shaking And In The Book Is The Precipitation Of My Physical Embodiment Transcending The Passage Of Earthly Molecularness Around Me, And I am Reading The Third Booky, And I do Not Exist But In Its Amazingness, My Abiding Adoration Of All The Characties is Bursting Forth In Weeping And In Laughter Across The Entire Series, The Only Difference Is That I've An Equal Adoration For <<Many Universes>> & <<Ingression>> Although My Preference is For <<Pleasures of Starvation>> Over Both <<Incipient Incineration>> & <<Waxdove>>, Contrarily I've An Adoration For The 2nd Actulus Of <<Incipient Incineration>>--It's A Declaration Of Adoration That The Characties And The Tale In <<Pleasures of Starvation>> are So Effusively Amazingness But In The Opening Actula Of <<Incipient Incineration>> It is Just Too Much My Adoration is Unsustainable But I am Settling Into The Rhythm Of The Tale--And My Adoration Of <<Waxdove>> is Perpetual--Primarily In The Reintegration Of <<Peto>>--But Making A Determination It is Probably <<Many Universes>> Because I am A Chainreader And I am Dissolving Into Its Texture--Anyone Else Full Of Desperation For More Text From <<Hemings's>> Vantage Or A Booky From <<Peto's>> Vantage --

-- Unlike My Son--Whose Bookies These are--I've A Significant Preference For The Romanticle Couplings In <<Many Universes>> With <<Hemings>> & <<Pris>> Being So Superior To <<Catpis>> & <<Peto>> & <<Koons>> In Every Way, Additionally I've A Preference For The Characties In <<Many Universes>>--Excluding <<Finn>> & <<Olivia>>--Most Characters In <<Pleasures of Starvation>> are Little Bitty Straighforwardy, But On The Perspective Of Action And Purely Loathsome Villainy My Preference is Certainly For <<Pleasures of Starvation>>, I am On The Edge Of My Bench With Its Immensity, It's An Admission That I've A Preference For The Worldbuilding Of <<Many Universes>>--Genetically Hybritic Birds are So Full Of Creativity--And The Cultural Sociology Of The World In The Elaborations of <<Ingression>>, So My Determination Is Full Of Complication But I am Leaning Towards <<Many Universes>> As The Greatest Work Of Literature --

-- My Belief is In A Preference For <<Many Universes>> But It's An Admission That I am Weepingly For The Tumultuousness Of The <<Pleasures of Starvation>> Characties, I am Empathetic To Their Suffering And Uncertainty And This is Not The Truth For <<Many Universes>> Even In The Rotational Hellishness Of Their Cognitions Because It Was Really Not A Primary Plotting Factor Or Personality Matrix Even With <<Pris>> is Flipping And Flailiculus Here And There Across Its Texture, Still <<Heming>> is So Much Superior Over <<Peto>>, He is Taking Care Of Himself And Swooningly Of Her --

-- With The Inspiracule Of Radien's Assertions I am Developing A Theory Of Readerly Involvemento In Which Both The Content And The Tactical Hypertextualitoon Of A Digitally Referential Encyclopedia is Representing The Most Intimately Occupiable Textual Space, It is Arguable Whether The Encyclopedia is A Booky--Or Characteristic Of Literature--Because It is Not In Possession Of Edges And It is Not A Body Although It is Indisputably Textual, My Determination is That <<Ingression>> is The Closest To An Occupiable Textspace In All Of Literature, Thacoori's Utilizeation Of Narratik Elements & Collagings Of Science & Unreliable Attribution is A Construction Of Vague--But Clearly Corporeal--Spacemass, Even Though I'm Reading <<Ingression>> One Word After Another--Although My Eyes are Blurring Clusterings Of Words Together Into Something I'm Wondering If It is Intentional--I've The Sensation Of Wandering & The Construction Of Internal Relationships On The Basis Of My Own Expectations And Predilections, And Thacoori's Prosellation is Dullness With Its Lacking Of Wonderment, Her Literary Mien Being So Journalistic That She is Naming <<Pris's>> Cat <<Stendhal>> --

-- The Obtuse Disposition Of Much Of The Text in <<Ingression>>--Its Word Choices & Phrasal Juxtaposition--is So Disorientingly Shutting Down Readerly Absorption And The Consciousness is Wandering In The Presence Of A Strange Peripheral Conversation, However, And Not For Any Particular Vexation Inherent To The Text Itself The Conscious Absorption returns And is Luxuriating In Richly Phonetic Playfulness & Cultural Resonance & Sonorous Flamboyance Of Such Encrustation That Excerpting A Usefully Illustratively Strident Quotelet is Not Possible, Even In The Most Selfsame Constructions The Sense Of Spatiality is Ambiguous In A Minim Of The Corpus --

-- <<Ingression>> is The Ballistic Wreckage Codification Of Our Culturally Linguistic Consciousness Falling From The Firmamentula Across An Interstitial Threshold Of Genrettes--Even In The Consideration That No Undertaking is Not Lying On The Borderland Of Multiple Territories Or Factions Or Phases--Because It is A Distillation Of Such Basic Materiality--Whose Only Appearance Of Difference is In The Manners By Which It is Affecting Any Adjacent Text Constructions In The Library--<<Many Universes>> & <<Indeterminate>> Most Conspicuously--Making Them Far More Obviously Novels and Making A Booky Such As <<Translations From Triangles To Cones, A „Many Universes“ Skeleton Key>> Obviously A Nonfictional Construction--That It Its Own Form is Indistinguishable And Unspecific Or Generic--Not Of The Lineage Of Gender Or Genre But Of Its Mutability As Byproduct Of Its Begottenness--, A Stemcell Folio is Becoming Only Not Whatever It is Under Consideration Against--Text is Lying In Adjacency To Itself In A Patterning That is Making It A Booky, And Only That is Certain --

-- The Selfloathing Construction Of A Stupefyingly Wearying Booky--Even Thacoori is Wading Through The Drudgery Of Her Compositional Methodology With Only The Assurance Of Its Radiant Inflection Of The Surrounding Volumes Of <<Many Universes>> & <<Indeterminate>>--is Not Peerless But is Latibulal For The Liminolaliac Constructor In The Clowder Of Bookies With Zloygorod's <<Der Walfisch>> Or Dymokhod Pleti's <<Boulevards & Peckish Hay>> Or Zhirnyy Svyashchennik's <<The Cathedral>>--Who Even In His Confidence As The Writer Of <<Backwards>> is Burying The Conscription Of All His Nonfictional Exposition In An Endless Parade of Attributory Guillemets--, Each Of These Being Atypical Volumes By These Writers, Each Being Critical Failurettes, Dom NaKholne is Declaring Of Svyashchennik's Tome <<I've No Affinity For Analogizing, But This Man is To Tolstyysteyk What A Toad is To A Nightingale>>, And For Pleti The Obsession With The Encyclopedic Amalgamemnon Of <<Boulevards>> is Sapping The Vitality From His Corpse Only For The Reception Of The Volume As <<Ponderous & Formless>> Although What Picaresque isn't, It is My Determination That These Bookies are Picaresques Of Wandering Not Through The Landscape But Through Cultural Knowledge, With Zloygorod Plumbing The Deepest In The Two Signatures Of <<Der Walfisch>>--Titularly <<„Extractions“>>--A Compendium Of Cetological Quotations & Factoids & Anecdotes Without Editorial Or Narrative Context --

-- You are Saying All Of This But My Determination is That <<Ingression>> is Tedidium And is Dragging The Whole Trilogina Into The Depths Of Turgidium, Focusing On <<Pris>> & <<Koons>>--Of All Characternies--Just Because <<Koons's>> Brotherkin--Who We are Never Meeting--is A Historian, And Only In The Ultimate Signaturelet is <<Hemings>> Seductively Surfacing --

-- <<Ingression>> is A Turdlet --
